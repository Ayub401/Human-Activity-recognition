# Human-Activity-recognition
In the project i have tried to build and ML and DL model to classify the activity perform by human. The activity mainly related to indoor activity such as walking, talking, standing, and sitting.
For the classification purpose i have used multiple ML algorithm and have compared thier performace parameter to select the best model. Moreover i have used LSTM while doing the same classification using Deep Learning. It would be a suprise to see the potential of the Deep Learning with just few hidden layers.

Application of human activity recognition.
  1. Monitering health
  2. expert can design the exercise activity table for the person based on his/her activity for his/her wellbeing.
  3. There are many advance sensors have been developed which can track many activity like sleep pattern, blood pressure, heart rate etc. All of these information can be      used to analyse he health of the person.
The data set used contains a lot engineered feature from the domain expert. This feature has been used to make the Machine learning model. The row data with some preprocessing is feed to Neural network  as it can learn the important feature by its own. The performance of the both the model has been compared.

In the gievn data set, target variable has six different classes as listed below. task to our model will be to classify each
1.	walking
2.	walking_upstairs
3.	walking_downstairs
4.	sitting
5.	standing
6.	laying


The data set have colected from 30 person through the mobile sensor. Few feature of the data set is listed below.

1.	body_acceleration
2.	gravity_acceleration
3.	body_acceleration_jerk
4.	body_angular_acceleration
5.	body_acceleration_magnitude
6.	gravity_acceleration_magnitude

### The accuracy of different ML model is shown below.
